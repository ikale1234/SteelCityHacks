# SteelCityHacks

## Our Project

As seen in the Devpost, this is a game that helps young kids learn how to solve math operations problems quickly. To play the game, you have to run the python file titled "game.py". 
To play this, you have to have to have the pygame module installed.

```shell
pip install pygame
python game.py
```
