## Our Project
As seen in the Devpost, this is a game that helps young kids learn how to solve math operations problems quickly. To play the game, you have to run the python file titled "game.py". 
You can do this by opening and running it in a compatible IDE, or typing in the command line "python game.py" while in the cloned directory.
