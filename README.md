## Our Project

This is a game that helps young kids learn how to solve math operations problems quickly. To play the game, you have to run the python file titled "game.py". 
To play this, you have to have to have the pygame module installed.

```shell
pip install pygame
python game.py
```


# Devpost Description

## Inspiration
As gamers, we enjoy fast-paced action-packed scenarios that will keep our mind distracted from the stress in our lives. We wanted to implement a game that requires reaction time, aim, and knowledge of math to be able to achieve great scores on it. We then created Quick Maths where you quickly answer math problems by precisely clicking choices flying across the screen. 

## What it does
This game educates young children on the main four operations in math, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The game first asks the user the type of operation that should be questioned and the level of difficulty of the question. There are four difficulties, one being the easiest, and four being the hardest. Children best learn when the basics are shown out them first, then gradually utilize the basics to solve for more difficult questions. In our game, level one addition only asks a one-digit value plus another one-digit value that has a sum which is a one-digit value. Level two addition allows that sum to be two digits giving the user another scenario that they have to adapt to. Having Children compete to get the best scores in a game drives them to answer with speed in an interactive and fun way. Having speed will help engrave the ability to answer a certain problem in one's head, making it second nature.

## How I built it
This program was made using pygame, which is a python module. It is made with object-oriented design, and each class is split into a separate file. The file with the game class runs the program. When we started off, one person made the circle clicking logic work, and the other person worked on getting addition math problems. After we made it somewhat far, We added the math problem to the circle game, with each of the circles having an answer choice. After that, the person working on math expanded on the math class, adding the four operations with different difficulty levels. The other person created a GUI for the difficulty and operation choices. He then added the logic for choosing the right answer and a timer. We then collaborated on polishing the game, with animation, sounds, and a background.

## Challenges we ran into
The main challenge was figuring out how to split up work. It is pretty hard to delegate when there are two people working on one project. This is part of why we chose an object-oriented design, so it would be easier to find separate parts of the project to work on.

## Accomplishments that we proud of
An accomplishment we are proud of is creating a game that will be useful to other people. Creating something that is beneficial to society with just a keyboard and a mouse is a nice accomplishment.

## What we learned
Something we are learned is that object-oriented design is very useful when splitting up work. By finding parts of the program that can be separated, tasks can be made for different people

## What's next for Quick Maths
This game is a good way to keep kids engaged in learning basic math, so we hope the game gets used in this practical sense in the future.
